    - Add new time zone for Omsk Standard Time.
    
    - Removed known bad time zone for author testing as time is now fixed.
    
    - Updated documentation to reflect newer operating systems.

1.93    2016-08-13

    - Run certain tests only during automated testing to avoid user test failures
      should time zones change before the module is updated.
      
    - Build changes to improve CPANTS Kwalitee score.

1.92    2016-08-12

    - Correct test failure when running as Administrator on Windows when using older
      versions of DateTime::TimeZone. RT 116909.
      
    - Added time zone as a known bad zone until Microsoft fixes updates. This affects
      author testing only and not functionality.

    - Correct mappings of a few time zones.

1.90    2016-06-27

      time zone key.

1.89    2016-06-27

    - Many new time zones and updates from May 2016 and June 2016 DST and time
      zone updates for Windows.
    
    - Fix test warnings when testing from non-admin shell using readonly registry values.
    
    - Remove Chile time zone as exception to prevent author test from failing.

    - Add support for new time zone in North Korea.

      registry. Currently, most testers have all tests skipped because they are
      not running as an Administrator during testing.
      
    - Add internal method to read Windows to IANA hash so as to enable testing for
      those with only read access to the registry.

1.85    2015-06-27

      DateTime::TimeZone::Local not being present. Patch by Dave Rolsky.
      
    - Change environment variable for author testing in main test script to
      be consistent with conventions.
      
    - Include extra modules when reporting prerequisites from testing.

      before any tests are run.

      will have a new time zone for Mexico.
    
    - Require latest DateTime-TimeZone-Local to ensure Windows mappings
      map to existing IANA time zones.


1.81    2015-02-18

    - Required Win32-TieRegistry v0.27 to fix failures on Perl 5.20.1.  
      RT #100334 & 102178.
    
    - Fix failures on Windows 2008 when newlines appear following null
      character in time zone name.  Patch in main code by Stuart Watt and for
      test by Tom Koelman.  RT #68607 & 70989.
      
    - Fix maintainer test to appropriate test time zones in current time, not
      historical time.


1.80    2014-11-16

    - This is the initial release creating a separate distribution for
      DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Win32. As a result, additional changes specific
      to the Windows platform should be made more often.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Earlier changes are a subset of the Win32-related changes from DateTime-TimeZone.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.78    2014-11-05

    - Fix warnings from Perl 5.8.8 and before. Apparently it doesn't like when
      $SIG{__DIE__} is set to undef. Patch by Peter Rabbitson. GitHub PR #88.


1.77    2014-11-04

    - Updated the mapping of Windows -> IANA time zones. Patch by David
      Pinkowitz. RT #10025.

    - Replaced Class::Load with Module::Runtime, and replaced eval with Try::Tiny.


1.55    2012-11-30

    - Updated mapping from Win32 to Olson time zone names. Patch by Andrey
      Makhnutin. RT #81456.


1.36    2011-08-29

    - This release is based on version 2011i of the Olson database. This release
      includes a new zone for South Sudan (Africa/Juba) and changes for Samoa,
      Kaliningrad (Russia), Alaska, Hawaii, Newfoundland/Labrador (Canada), and
      Resolute Bay.

    - Require ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.58+. This fixes an installation problem on
      Windows.

    - Updates for Win32 time zones. Patch by David Pinkowitz.


1.19    2010-05-10

      creates a new zone for Mexico (America/Bahia_Banderas).

    - Dateline time zone on Win32 now always maps to a fixed -12:00 zone. Patch by
      David Pinkowitz.


1.17    2010-04-10

    - Updated Win32 to Olson name translation mapping. Patch by David
      Pinkowitz. RT #56445.


1.07    2009-12-24

    - Fixed for local time zone determination on Win32. Our tests broke after the
      December 2009 Cumulative Time Zone Update from Microsoft. Patch by David
      Pinkowitz. RT #52978.


0.98    2009-09-11

    - Fixes for Win32 time zones. Added handling for new Windows time zones,
      thanks to Jim Brunette. This should fix test failures on some Win32 systems.


0.85    2009-03-16

    - This release is based on version 2009c of the Olson database. The
      only changes in this release are for Cuba.

    - Fixes for Win32 with Microsoft's December time zone update. This
      updated added a zone for Mauritius that wasn't accounted for in the
      DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Win32 module. Reported by David
      Pinkowitz. RT #43535.

    - Added a hack to fix some brokenness with Module::Build::Compat that
      causes the compatibility Makefile.PL to fail on really old
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker versions (6.17 and older). RT #43605.


0.8301  2008-11-07

    - Test fixes only. The 19local-win32 tried to skip tests when they're
      run without write access to the registry, but this was done in a
      very broken way.


0.83    2008-10-27

    - This release is based on version 2008i of the Olson database. The
      major changes in this release are for Argentina.

    - Updated the docs on how the local time zone is determined for
      various platforms.


0.7904  2008-08-30

    - Added three more Windows time zone names to the Windows -> Olson
      mapping. This should fix test failures on up-to-date Windows
      boxes. Patch by David Pinkowitz. RT #38735.


0.79    2008-07-29

    - This release is based on version 2008e of the Olson database. The
      major changes in this release are for Mauritius and Central Europe
      (historical changes only).

    - Fixes for the local TZ tests on Win32. Thanks to David Pinkowitz for
      pointing out my mistake.


0.7701  2008-06-03

    - Many fixes and improvements to the tests for local time zone
      handling on Windows. Based on a patch from David Pinkowitz.

    * There are no code changes in this release besides these test
      changes.


0.77     2008-05-27

    - This release is based on version 2008c of the Olson database. The
      major changes in this release are for Morocco, Mongolia, and
      Pakistan.

    - More Windows changes from David Pinkowitz. Determining the local
      time zone on a Win32 system should now work regardless of the
      system's locale. Previously it only worked for English language
      systems. RT #36201.


0.76     2008-05-18

    * Dropped support for Perl 5.005.

    - Made the Win32 local time zone bits work on Vista and Server
      2008. Patch by David Pinkowitz. RT #35733.


0.75     2008-04-25

    - A stray STORABLE_attach method in DT::TZ::Floating caused freezing
      and thawing a floating timezone with Storable to fail
      badly. Reported by Kostas Chatzikokolakis.

    - Changed the local time zone detection on Win32 to only require read
      access to the registry. Patch by David Pinkowitz. RT #35273.


0.6904   2007-11-09

    - Updated the Windows -> Olson conversion table, though it's still
      English-only. Added some more Win32 tests to hopefully help diagnose
      a test failure report from a Win32 tester.


0.6903   2007-11-08

    - The Win32::TieRegistry prereq was requiring version 1.0, which
      doesn't exist. I meant to require just any version. Reported by
      CJM. RT #30580.

    - No code changes in this release.


0.6902   2007-11-05

    - Fixed many sloppy uses of eval blocks which would leave $@ set after
      calling various DT::TZ methods/functions. This could cause unrelated
      error checking to find $@ set to something and log an error or
      die. Reported by Kat.


0.6901   2007-11-02

    - Add Win32::TieRegistry to our prereqs if we're on Win32. Reported by
      Ruud H.G. van Tol.


0.61     2007-02-18

    - Lots of internal changes in the code used to determine a system's
      local time zone.

    - As a result, we now have a much better method for doing this on
      Windows systems, by looking at the registry. See
      DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Win32 for details.
